# Healthcare Management System

## Project Overview
The Healthcare Management System is a comprehensive digital platform aimed at modernizing healthcare record-keeping by transitioning from paper-based methods to a secure digital platform. Our system leverages advanced AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently process medical documents, extract meaningful insights, and provide clinical decision support.

### Primary Goals
- Improve the accuracy and accessibility of patient records
- Enhance communication between doctors and patients
- Reduce administrative workload through AI-assisted automation
- Ensure data security and privacy compliance with healthcare regulations

### Target Audience
Our intended audience includes healthcare facilities of various sizes, from individual practices to clinics and hospitals, as well as their patients who will benefit from improved access to their healthcare information and more efficient communication with their providers.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication and Role Management**: Secure login for doctors, patients, and staff with role-based access control to ensure appropriate data access permissions.

- **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Digital platform where patients can upload medical history, lab reports, and prescriptions; doctors can update consultation notes and treatment plans.

- **AI-Powered Medical Data Analysis**: Integration of LLMs to automatically extract, categorize, and analyze information from medical documents; intelligent query system for natural language searches; and clinical decision support based on comprehensive patient data analysis.

- **Secure Messaging and Notifications**: HIPAA-compliant communication channel between doctors and patients; automated appointment and medication reminders to improve adherence.

- **Search and Filtering**: Efficient retrieval system with natural language query capabilities for patient history, medications, and diagnoses to support clinical decision-making and improve healthcare delivery.

- **Data Security and Compliance**: Implementation of robust encryption and HIPAA-compliant security protocols to protect sensitive patient information.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Django**: For robust security features, ORM capabilities, and built-in admin interface
- **Python ML Libraries**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for implementing machine learning models
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For implementing and fine-tuning LLMs specialized for medical text analysis

### Frontend
- **Django**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface

### Database
- **SQLite**: A reliable and secure relational database management system

### Security
- **JWT**: For secure authentication and session management
- **HTTPS**: For encrypted data transmission
- **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing

## Project Status
